# Web-Scraping-Python
## This is a coding challenge consists of two questions.
1. The first one is to to extract the first 1000 employee reviews from Glassdoor.com of a target company.
   The reviews consist of the following info:
      * Employee status (location, title, current or previous, etc)
      * Positive & negative reviews towards the company
      * Personal recommendations
      
   The language I used was Python. The source code as well as the data are stored in folder Q1.
2. The second one is based on a setting that chain-store A merged chain-store B. Now the boss of chain-store A would like to make a decision of where to put its new store in order to not disturb the business of both A and B.
      * The way I approached this question was to first get the location data of both stores. Then, make a distinguishable dotted map. Lastly, draw an conclusion of the best location to put the new store.
      
      The language I used was Python and the source code & slides representation & data are in folder Q2.
